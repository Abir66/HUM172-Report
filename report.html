            <h3 class="border-bottom border-3 ">Introduction</h3>
            <p>An online class is a class or course conducted through a digital learning management system,
                over the internet, where teachers and students can directly communicate with each other
                through live audio or video exchange. In the past online courses have mostly been limited to
                MOOCs (Massively Open Online Courses), such as those offered by companies edX, Udemy
                or Coursera. In the past two decades, many traditional universities in developed countries have
                also gradually adopted the online course system for long-distance learners from overseas.
                However, these have mostly been directed towards irregular students or those attending very
                specialized courses. In the context of Bangladesh, however, online classes have become
                relevant only with the spread of the COVID-19 Coronavirus. In fact, they have started to
                become mainstream worldwide, at all levels of education starting from pre-primary, as a
                replacement to regular classes, due to the restrictions on movement and lockdowns brought
                about by the global pandemic.
            </p>

            <h4>Background</h4>
            <p>The SARS-CoV-2 virus was confirmed to spread to Bangladesh in March 2020, with the first
                case being reported on March 8, 2020. The first coronavirus death was reported on March 18,
                and soon after, on March 23, a general lockdown was announced by the government. As the
                public holiday kept being extended due to no improvement in the public health situation, online
                classes officially first came into discussion around late May to early June 2020. An online
                survey was conducted by the University Grants Commission over April and May, and a letter
                on their findings from the survey was sent to the Ministry of Education on June 4, with the
                intention of forming an Online Education Learning Policy for the then situation and the days
                to come. The survey concluded that universities were not yet capable of conducting online
                classes due to the shortage of technical facilities and funds. Furthermore, four of the topranking
                public universities - University of Dhaka, Bangladesh University of Engineering and
                Technology (BUET), Jahangirnagar University, and University of Chittagong - reported that
                they were not intending to conduct online classes over the pandemic unless the government
                were to provide all the required facilities. The survey indicated that schools, colleges,
                and madrasas were even worse equipped for online education. Following a meeting on June
                18 with the VCs of public universities, the UGC sought special budget allocation from the
                ministry. UGC Secretary Prof. Ferdous Zaman told the Dhaka Tribune: “The government
                agreed in principle to conduct online classes in public universities even as 38% of students do
                3
                not have smartphones or laptops.” Finally, on June 25, the UGC asked all public universities
                to start academic activities over the internet from July. As quoted by New Age, UGC Chairman
                Kazi Shahidullah said, “The practical classes and examinations, however, will not be conducted
                through the online classes. After resuming normalcy, practical classes and examinations will
                be conducted.” However, as the general holiday kept getting extended, many universities and
                lower-level institutions continued conducting classes and exams, with some even conducting
                practical classes virtually. Interviewing students from some of the top universities and colleges
                in Dhaka, it was also found that a large number of them had granted students promotion to the
                next semester or year of education based on the results of term finals conducted online. The
                HSC and equivalent exams of 2020 had to be cancelled and grades were assigned based on
                students' scores in the previous JSC and SSC public exams. The SSC and equivalent exams of
                2021 faced the same fate and the possibility of conducting higher secondary level examinations
                in 2021 is still under scrutiny. The Ministry of Education, on multiple occasions, tried resuming
                academic activities of schools, colleges and universities on campus, every time resulting in the
                extension of the closure imposed. In late February, Education Minister Dipu Moni finally
                announced the reopening of all institutions up to the higher secondary level on March 30. Still,
                an abrupt rise in the number of COVID-19 cases and deaths caused by them clearly indicated
                the beginning of a second wave of the Coronavirus in Bangladesh. Nation-wide lockdown from
                April 4 was quickly imposed, nullifying all possibilities of resuming on-campus classes. As of
                late April 2021, online classes and examinations still continue being conducted in Bangladesh
                across a large number of institutions of all levels, while teachers, students and their guardians
                have not ceased to complain about all the hurdles involved in the process.</p>

            <!-- 1.2 -->
            <h4> Online Classes: Views and Perspectives of the Students</h4>
            <p>All educational institutions in Bangladesh remain closed since March 17. However, educational
                institutions gradually leaned towards an online education system. It is obvious that as an instant
                change the system was imperfect and everybody has had a hard time adjusting to it. However,
                after almost a year, students have both positive and negative feelings towards it.
            </p>
            <p>First of all, each and every student is happy that online classes are happening. The monotonous
                lives of students as they are in home quarantine for a lengthy period are diversified by online
                classes. It also creates a bridge between students and teachers to stay connected virtually.
                Online classes also help the students to lead a disciplined life although they are staying at home.
                Students also think that shifting to online learning was quite a wise decision. Otherwise, due to
                4
                this long-lasting pandemic, students would be lagging far behind. Those who were in their final
                semesters have already graduated and new students are also being admitted into many
                institutions.</p>

            <p>However, the negative reviews about this system are quite a lot among the students than the
                positive ones. The main challenges are economic issues, network and electricity problems and
                health issues. From our survey, we also get a look at these problems individually. Almost 70%
                of the students have to spend 500-1000 taka per month for their internet connection and those
                who are in the rural area have to use mobile data. In that case, they need more than a thousand
                taka every month. Yet network issues are not solved. More than 50% of students face network
                issues or load shedding 1-3 times every day, and they have sometimes missed exams or
                deadlines due to this problem. Also, for some students, this thing is so severe that they can’t
                even do their classes properly.</p>

            <p>Aside from these problems, students are not quite satisfied with the structure of their online
                courses. More than 70% of students feel that the course structures followed in online are not
                good enough. Students also don't find the online evaluation process fair and accurate. That's
                why many students have suggested withholding online exams and continuing the classes only.</p>

            <h3 class="border-bottom border-3 ">COVID-19 and the Current Condition of the Education
                System in Bangladesh</h3>

            <p>After the first confirmed case of COVID-19, the Ministry of Education and UGC announced
                the closure of all primary, secondary and tertiary educational institutions from 17 March until
                30 March. From then onwards, there have been several more announcements of extension of
                the shutdown. Bangladesh, as a developing nation, continues to struggle in terms of education
                affordability. Many online platforms have sprung forth, but no standardized or well-regulated
                ones to cater to the general. Many of the software, namely Zoom, Facebook, Skype, MS Teams
                and others, require premium accounts, high-speed internet and may look complicated to use.
                Such mismanaged and unmitigated closure has had many repercussions, including restricted
                intellectual progress and the economic insufficiency of all people involved. A UNICEF survey
                shows that globally 14 countries have remained veritably closed from March 2020 to February
                2021, of whom Bangladesh stands as the 3rd worst performer. Many experts opine that there
                is an endless scope of improvement.</p>

            <!-- 2.1 -->
            <h4>Closure of Educational Institutes due to Lockdown</h4>

            <p>After March 23, 2020, all academic activities in the country were instructed by the government
                to close down activities on campus. Soon after, all board exams after March 2020, including
                PEC, JSC and HSC, were cancelled and students were handed an auto-promotion to the next
                class. The pandemic has also forced to shut down the halls, hostels, messes and other residential
                facilities provided to the students. Shadow education programs and coaching centers had to
                also shut down in the face of economic infeasibility and lack of students.</p>
            <p>The government was unable to celebrate the annual 'Book Day', although all primary and
                secondary textbooks were made freely available online. Since most children in Bangladesh do
                not have access to the internet, the government has been broadcasting lessons on television for
                school students. Most of the universities are conducting online classes, even though not all of
                the feedback was positive. The only sector that turns out to be the least affected is the Qawmi
                Madrasa curriculum, which under a string of health restrictions has been allowed by the
                government to continue classes and take exams, since most of their institutions are residential
                in nature and are easy to control and monitor. </p>
            <p>Following the closure for over a year, the schools have taken preparations to resume classes in
                a restrained manner from May 30 this year, although the pandemic shows no sign of being
                subdued. In its 47th annual report to the government, the UGC suggested formulating a policy
                to introduce a unified test for students vying for a seat at the private universities in Dhaka. On
                the other hand, admission tests in major public universities were halted until March of this year.</p>

            <!-- 2.2 -->
            <h4>Conducting Online Classes with the Help of Technology</h4>
            <p>Due to the lockdown during the COVID-19 pandemic, our education system had become
                completely stagnant. But due to the easy availability of digital communication technologies in
                today's world, a new method of conducting classes soon came forward. For online classes,
                students and teachers need a suitable device with a reliable internet connection and an online
                platform or LMS (Learning Management System).</p>
            <p class="mb-0"><strong>Devices needed for online classes:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li class="mb-0">Laptops/Desktops</li>
                <li class="mb-0">Smartphones</li>
                <li>Tablets</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The main requisites of these devices are they must have a clear front camera, supported 4G/LTE
                for good bandwidth, enough screen size for a good vision</p>
            <p><strong>The main requisites of these devices are they must have a clear front camera, supported 4G/LTE
                    for good bandwidth, enough screen size for a good vision.</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Zoom: </strong>Zoom is a great software launched by Zoom Video Communications, especially
                    for video conferencing, web conferencing etc. But after the lockdown, it has become one of the most
                    reliable online platforms for conducting online classes. This software has many features to make the
                    class fruitful for students, like mute and unmute options, video on/off options, screen share,
                    sharing whiteboard, participant control, waiting room, breakout room, class recording, etc. But it
                    lacks some features to use as an LMS.</li>
                <li><strong>Google Meet: </strong>Google Meet is Google's web meeting platform. It is also a widely used
                    medium of online classes. It has the almost same features as Zoom has. But its interface is a little
                    bit messier compared to Zoom. </li>
                <li><strong>Google Classroom :</strong>Google Classroom is a free web platform with for creating,
                    distributing and grading assignment. Its purpose is to streamline the process of file sharing
                    between teachers and students. Its integration with google drive and google meet makes it a good
                    LMS.</li>
                <li><strong>Microsoft Teams :</strong>Microsoft Teams is a business commutation platform developed by
                    Microsoft. However, because of its rich features many institutions have taken it as their platform
                    for conduction online classes. It has a web meeting service, file sharing service, messaging service
                    and many other features - which make it a complete LMS. Its integration with OneDrive and other
                    Microsoft products has make online classes and evaluation process a lot easier.</li>
                <li><strong>Facebook Live and YouTube Live :</strong>Facebook Live and YouTube Live are good for
                    streaming. These does not come with as many features as the other platforms. However, because easy
                    access and low latency streaming with less bandwidth some teachers choose these for taking live
                    classes.</li>

            </ul>


            <h3 class="border-bottom border-3 ">Online Classes in the Viewpoint of Bangladesh</h3>
            <p>Despite the best efforts of both students and authorities, online classes are not going smoothly.
                Bangladesh being a developing country, has a lack of proper infrastructure. According to our
                survey, 99.2% of the students face some sort of inconveniences during online classes</p>

            <!-- gotta insert pic -->

            <figure class="graph-pic text-center">
                <img src="assets/graph-1.PNG" class="img-fluid" alt="Inconvenience
                faced by students in online classes">
            </figure>

            <h4>Network Problems</h4>
            <p>The digitization process of Bangladesh is slow in comparison to other modern and developed
                countries. So, the infrastructure, as well as the socio-economic condition of Bangladesh, are
                not up to the mark to provide a smooth internet connection all over the country. But a good
                internet connection is a must to conduct online classes. There are some ways of providing
                internet connection in our country. But none of the ways is faultless.</p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Mobile Network: </strong>More than 90% of internet users of Bangladesh are mobile internet
                    users. There are 3 types of mobile internet connection 2G (50% users), 3G (38% users)
                    and 4G (12% users) (differentiated with maximum bandwidth speed and network
                    strength). 4G is the best among the three, but it was launched a few years ago and had
                    coverage in only a few major areas. But, truly speaking, none of these networks is
                    stable. Again, none of the networks can provide their maximum bandwidth speed.
                    Moreover, the speed and stability largely vary to different mobile SIM operators.</li>
                <li><strong>Wireless/Broadband Network: </strong>The network speed of wireless/broadband connection
                    is more stable than a mobile network but not up to the mark. The ISP (Internet Service
                    Provider) doesn't always provide the maximum bandwidth as they mention. Moreover,
                    the network sometimes lags heavily because of poor bandwidth. Again, sometimes they
                    stop providing connection due to server maintenance, update etc.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <!-- 3.2 -->
            <h4> High Cost of Bandwidth </h4>
            <p>The current pandemic exposed many shortcomings of the country's mobile network and
                internet infrastructure, which cannot but profit off the helplessness of the masses. An average
                duration class may take 300 MB of data and if a student attends 3 classes per day, he will need
                to spend around 1 gigabyte of data, which is beyond the reach of many families in Bangladesh.
                64.3% of our subjects had to make adjustments in order to overcome the expenses that came
                with the online transition, either by setting up new connections, increasing the internet cost or
                to some extent even changing their location of abode. 92.8% of our subjects spend over BDT
                500 per month on internet expenses, and more than a third of them (39.8%) spend over BDT
                1000 monthly.
            </p>
            <p>SANEM estimated that 43.90% of the students' families could fall victim to poverty due to the
                pandemic, forcing 7.70 million additional students' families to enter poverty. Their survey back
                in June 2020 showed that 44.7% of the students could not attend online classes due to lack of
                8
                logistics. Moreover, mobile phone users will have to pay higher bills as supplementary duty is
                set to increase to 15% from the current 10% in the proposed budget for the fiscal year 2020-
                21. Students will now have to pay a 33.25% tax to the government for mobile phone use instead
                of the previous 15%. Therefore, to avail a service worth Tk 100, users will have to recharge Tk
                133.25. Or, for each Tk 100 recharge, a user will get services worth Tk 75.05. The education
                minister has asked the mobile phone authorities to improve the quality and compromise the
                expense from their CSR funds. However, the companies are yet to respond to this call.</p>

            <h4>Unavailability of Smart Devices</h4>
            <p>Finance Minister AHM Mustafa Kamal, in his budget speech, pointed out that 40 million
                students are not being able to continue regular academic curriculums across Bangladesh.</p>

            <p>According to a study by the Bangladesh Teachers' Network, around 40% of the students of
                Dhaka University are unable to buy devices and internet packages. The latest 2020 data of
                HIES (Household Income and Expenditure Survey) showed that around 12.70% of the poor
                families do not have a single mobile phone.</p>

            <p>A survey by BioTED BD in June 2020 revealed the underlying fact of this strong dissent when
                they found only 55.3% of the students having access to a laptop, PC, or a tablet to attend an
                online class. An average proficient laptop cost ranges from 40 thousand taka to 70 thousand
                taka, which is far above the average income of a household. To make matters worse, laptops
                are not available in places other than large cities. Despite all of these, 46% of our subjects have
                admittedly managed newer devices solely for their online education. Only 27% of our
                participants have shown satisfaction regarding the current infrastructure. </p>

            <!-- 3.4 -->
            <h4>Rural Area Problems</h4>
            <p>The rural areas of Bangladesh are not well developed. Electricity is a major concern. Load
                shedding is constant in these places. Power is gone for hours, especially in the working hours
                of the day. Moreover, the internet connection is terrible. There is no facility to use the
                broadband connection in most cases. And as for mobile data, the internet connection is very
                slow and unstable. It is not suitable for doing live classes. Also, paying for mobile data is a big
                burden for many rural folks.</p>

            <p>At the pre-university level, most schools and colleges in the countryside are not conducting
                online classes as most of the teachers and students do not have the necessary devices or skills
                for classes to be conducted online. Hence, the students are falling behind compared to the ones
                in urban areas.</p>

            <h4>Load Shedding</h4>
            <p>According to the Power Development Board (PDB), our country's actual power generation
                capacity is 19,107 MW. But despite having surplus electricity, we are not getting an
                uninterrupted power supply. After a survey, it was found that the residents of Mohammadpur,
                Dhaka face load shedding every day for 20-60 minutes in the lockdown. The condition is even
                worse in other urban and rural areas. Thus, we are facing a lot of trouble in our online education
                system. According to our survey, 71% of the students face load shedding during online classes
                every day. Students face many inconveniences attending online classes due to this frequent
                load shedding. Also, according to our survey, 82% of the students use broadband as their main
                mode of internet connection, which becomes useless during load shedding and students have
                to spend extra money to buy mobile data for that time. Moreover, sometimes due to bad
                weather, transformers get destroyed, connection wires get torn. These take a long time to fix.
                Thus, power is gone for hours, and so is the wi-fi. Our survey shows that 32.3% of the students
                have faced difficulties attending online classes due to load shedding during bad weather.
            </p>

            <!-- 3.6 -->
            <h4>Socioeconomic Disparity</h4>
            <p>School students, especially those who study in government institutions, are among the worsthit sections
                of our society by COVID-19. The lockdown triggered by the pandemic has not just
                left school education haywire but also made it costly and out of reach of children from poorer
                families. The kids who study in government schools are likely to suffer in many ways due to
                the emerging situation. The sad part is that the government's education department does not
                yet have a policy on this. </p>
            <p>Online education, although being a well-intentioned move, is bound to widen the digital divide
                in society. Poor and middle-class parents already hit by income loss have been forced to cough
                up extra money on their kids' smartphones, tabs, laptops etc. According to our survey, almost
                80% of students had to make some adjustments in order to take online classes. </p>

            <!-- pic deoya lagbe -->
            <figure class="graph-pic text-center">
                <img src="assets/graph-2.PNG" class="img-fluid" alt="Adjustments students had to make for online classes">
            </figure>
            <p>Moreover, kids from these families are unable to catch up with online classes. A major reason
                for the poor efficacy of online classes is the lack of concentration power of students in lower
                classes and not-so-great technical quality of apps that connect teachers and students—either
                audio or video is of poor quality with frequent interruptions in internet connectivity. Many
                students from rural areas, in fact, parents too, are still to believe that smartphones can also be
                tools of education.
            </p>

            <h4>Fairness of Evaluations</h4>
            <p>Unlike the traditional in-class exams, there are many obstacles in conducting a fair evaluation
                online. Online exams limit the capacity for standard forms of educator observation. A typical
                class in our country has 30-60 students. Teachers cannot monitor every student simultaneously
                in a video call with a tiny computer screen, which leaves the students a big chance of cheating
                in various ways. During an online exam, a student can open the browser, search his question
                on Google and copy the answer, and the teacher will have no way of knowing or proving that.</p>
            <p>Almost every class has some group chats among students on Messenger, WhatsApp, Discord,
                or other platforms. They can discuss answers among themselves during an exam which ruins
                the entire purpose of individual evaluation. Another problem unique to online classes is hiring
                a third party to take an exam by proxy. Students can ask a senior student or a friend from
                another class or other institution and, if needed, pay a reasonable fee for answering the
                questions for them in the exam. This is mainly seen at the university level. According to our
                survey, 86% of the students themselves think that online evaluation is not fair.</p>

            <h3 class="border-bottom border-3 ">Impacts of Online Classes on Students</h3>
            <p>It has been over a year since the lockdown began. Almost all of the universities and many
                schools and colleges have been trying their best to continue their classes over the internet,
                though not all feedbacks were positive. Students have been facing many issues attending
                classes online. These have been impacting the students physically, mentally and academically.</p>


            <!-- 4.1 -->
            <h4>Impacts on Physical Health</h4>
            <p>Students spend a significant amount of time in their online classes, about 4-7 hours daily. This
                huge amount of screen time leads to unavoidable physical health issues like:
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Stress on the eyes: </strong>One of the most notable concerns of online classes is eye
                    strain.
                    The more hours spent in front of the screen, the more likely it is that intense eye strain
                    will occur. This is partly due to the blue light generated by the computer or phone
                    screen. This eventually leads to decreasing in eyesight, myopia, dry eye syndrome or
                    computer vision syndrome. Doctors recommend taking a break after every 30 minutes
                    of screen time. However, this is not an option for most of the students. Because after
                    one class, they often have another mandatory class right after, leaving no time to give
                    the eyes a break.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Poor Ergonomics: </strong>Poor ergonomics is another concern of online classes. Most of the
                    students use regular tables and chairs, which is not good for long time computer use.
                    They also do not maintain a good posture. They sit in the same spot for a long period
                    of time and do not stretch their muscles. All these contribute to back pain, neck or
                    shoulder pain, rounded shoulders, Fibromyalgia and other musculoskeletal disorders.</li>
                <li><strong>Overuse of headphones: </strong>A large number of students use headphones during online
                    classes. It blocks the air passage in the ear canals and creates pressure on the eardrums.
                    Using headphones for hours causes dizziness, hearing loss, ear infections, ear pain,
                    NIHL (Noise-Included Hearing Loss), Tinnitus and headache.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Sleep deprivation: </strong>Insomnia symptoms are common in students taking regular online
                    classes. Staring at the screen for a long time causes less production of melatonin, a
                    hormone responsible for sleepiness. Thus, it disrupts the sleep cycle of a person.
                    According to a study, 87.4% of the students who had more than 2 hours of screen time
                    had difficulties falling asleep at night.</li>
            </ul>


            <h4>Impacts on Mental Health</h4>
            <p>The mental and emotional pressures experienced by students can lower immunity and thus
                cause deteriorated physical health. Online education can affect mental health in several ways:</p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Anxiety and stress: </strong>As students are not accustomed to the online education system
                    yet,
                    it is quite hard for them to keep progress at the same rate as before. Therefore, students
                    often get worried about their studies and progress. These thoughts and constant anxiety
                    leave a deep scar on the mental health of any child, teenager or young adult.</li>
                <li><strong>Staying focused: </strong>Staring at a fixed point on a screen for hours can lead to very
                    distracting
                    and uncomfortable tension headaches. The temptation to surf social media during online
                    lessons is also another reason for losing focus. In a normal class, a walk in the hallway
                    or a little chat with friends helped students regain concentration. But in online classes,
                    students often force themselves to stay focused in the class against their will.</li>
                <li><strong>Camera anxiety: </strong>: Online classes have increased the pressure of looking presentable
                    at
                    all times. Some students tend to be hyper-aware of their appearance on camera. Although
                    this concern differs from person to person, for some students, this may lead to depression,
                    lack of confidence and many other problems.</li>
                <li><strong>Lack of social interaction: </strong>Shifting classrooms to the virtual world has impacted
                    students' social life the most. Online classes don't offer the scope to share feelings with
                    friends, and so some students may feel that they are losing bonds with their friends.
                    Students also don't get the attention from teachers that they used to get in the classroom.</li>
                <li><strong>Virtual Learning Fatigue: </strong> Spending a significant amount of time online can fatigue
                    students. Part of the reason a day full of video interactions is so mentally draining is that
                    human brains cannot process information in the way it is accustomed to. In face-to-face
                    interactions, there are several nonverbal cues, such as body language, voice tone, or facial
                    expressions. When it is difficult to pick up on these cues, the brain must work harder to
                    interpret the information it is receiving, causing extra mental fatigue.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Impacts on Academics and Learning</h4>
            <p>A change in the medium of conducting courses affects not only the physical and mental health
                of learners but also their overall experience and quality of learning, along with the integrity of
                their academics. The following factors come into play here:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Lack of consistency in course structure: </strong>A traditional classroom setup has a fixed
                    structure consisting of a learning environment, evaluation methods, and a system of
                    rewards and penalties. Students in most educational institutions have reported a lack of
                    consistency in the medium of conducting their classes and evaluations across various
                    courses or subjects. Learners are often required to go out of their way and use different
                    platforms to attend classes or exams than the one officially fixed by their institutions.
                    19.3% of the students surveyed even responded that their institution did not have a fixed
                    platform or LMS at all, making it more difficult for many learners to follow the
                    structures and requirements of courses.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Unreliability and unfairness in evaluations: </strong>Conducting evaluations, particularly
                    exams, online is significantly different from conducting them in person. The online
                    education experience varies too much from student to student, depending on their
                    socioeconomic background and geographical location, causing discrepancies in
                    academic results. The limited scope of invigilation during evaluations further weakens
                    the authenticity of these. Due to the reduced authenticity of academic results,
                    universities, particularly foreign ones are unwilling to trust the standard of evaluation
                    at the high school level or the auto-promotion results granted for canceled public
                    examinations based on previous examinations. Following this trend, employers are also
                    reluctant to trust the authenticity of the grades from university semesters that were
                    conducted online. Thus, due to the problems brought on by online classes and
                    assessments, the academic and professional careers of the students are directly affected.</li>
                <li><strong>Poor growth of practical and professional skills: </strong>Due to a blatant lack in the
                    element
                    of interactivity in online classes, it is just exceptionally difficult to conduct sessionals
                    or laboratory classes online. This greatly affects students in technical disciplines whose
                    professional abilities and careers largely depend on practical skills that cannot be
                    effectively taught without proper interaction in person with technical equipment.</li>
            </ul>





            <!-- 5 -->

            <h3 class="border-bottom border-3 ">Conclusion</h3>
            <p>As a developing economy which is poorly connected compared to its neighbors and the rest of
                the world, Bangladesh is quite obviously not very ideally suited for the conduction of online
                classes as a mainstream mode of education. A large portion of the country's student body still
                lacks the resources needed to participate in academics through the internet.</p>
            <p>With no set date for the return to physical classrooms, it is up to students and teachers to make
                the best of online learning, and it is up to authorities to make the path for them as devoid of
                hassles as possible. Learning online is different from learning in a face-to-face setting, and for
                students, it is important to think about their own interests, needs and goals before committing
                themselves to the virtual classroom experience. Several factors come into play, such as the time
                they have at disposal, their comfort levels and access to technology, high-speed internet, the
                platform being used by the institution, etc. </p>
            <p>The pandemic has shown us that online learning is going to be part of our reality. The opinions
                of learners suggest that only through the utmost cooperation between them, their teachers,
                authorities of the educational institutions and government bodies, it will be possible to optimize
                the allocation of resources and maintenance of standards with the limited resources available</p>



            <!-- 6 -->

            <h3 class="border-bottom border-3 ">Recommendations</h3>
            <p>Adopting a new mode of education is quite a challenge for everyone. The system is not perfect
                yet, and because of the pandemic and economic condition of the country, there are more
                challenges to face than usual. According to our survey, students feel that these changes should
                be brought in to improve the quality and accessibility of online classes</p>

            </figure>
            

            <h4>Suitable Rules for Conducting Online Classes:</h4>
            <p>Some suitable protocols should be maintained in order to make online classes convenient for
                both the student and teachers. Such as-
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>The teacher should maintain a fixed LMS for his/her course like Google Classroom or
                    Microsoft Teams.</li>
                <li>The teacher should provide lecture materials like pdf, presentations, class recordings
                    etc. to the class so that if some students miss the class, they can go through these later.
                    Hence, online storage services like Google Drive or OneDrive can be used.</li>
                <li>The teachers should be flexible about giving attendance. If a student can show a valid
                    reason for his/her absence, the teachers may consider him/her. </li>
                <li>Teachers should give a reasonable submission time for online evaluations or
                    assignments. If someone gets infected by covid and cannot attend online exams, the
                    authority should take his/her exams later separately, at a convenient time.</li>
            </ul>


            <h4>Importance on Students' Opinions</h4>
            <p>Taking students' opinion is necessary for any kind of education system. But in online systems,
                it is a prime need. In the online education system, there lie many issues and problems for the
                students. So, the teachers and authority should stay in touch with every student. They should
                encourage students to express their problems and opinions freely and maintain privacy. Many
                students face different financial, residential, and family problems to maintain online classes
                regularly. So, there must be an open and confidential section where students can freely express
                their problems. Every student can have their own opinions and resolutions of the teaching style,
                teaching duration, and evaluation methods. So, the authority should maintain privacy and
                collect information from the students and do what is necessary for the betterment of the
                students.
            </p>


            <h4>Ensuring Proper Bandwidth and Devices for all Students</h4>

            <p>Technical issues such as internet connectivity, packet loss and latency can hinder successful
                online teaching. In this regard, Students might use a wired internet connection (Ethernet LAN)
                to improve their internet connectivity and reduce technical issues. However, not all students
                have consistent access to high-speed internet, so it is important to provide low bandwidth and
                asynchronous learning materials and activities to mitigate connectivity issues. Alternatives of
                16
                live teaching such as pre-recorded materials with a discussion-board activity that do not require
                high levels of internet connectivity should be considered.
            </p>
            <p>However, if live teaching activities are unavoidable, these techniques can be applied to reduce
                the required bandwidth:</p>

            <ul>
                <li class="mb-0">Having fewer people per meeting</li>
                <li class="mb-0">Decreasing video quality</li>
                <li class="mb-0">Turning off the participant video feed</li>
                <li>Limiting video and application sharing</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Also, every institution must ensure that every student has a proper device for online classes. If
                any student is unable to get one, the institution should help him in this regard.</p>

            <!-- 6.4 -->
            <h4>Adaptation of Course Content to an Online System</h4>
            <p>Online and offline classes are not the same. Taking online classes the same way as offline ones
                is not effective. Online classes should not be just a video of a person talking in front of a
                blackboard or just reading a PDF. Online classes should be dynamic. Making multimedia
                presentations, annotating on the screen with a graphics tablet, using simulation software etc.
                can make the lectures interesting, more effective and easier to follow. Teachers should try to
                make their classes more interactive. Otherwise, it will be just a one-sided lecture and students
                will eventually lose interest in the class and get distracted with other things.</p>
            <p>Teachers should also care about their time management. Unlike offline in-person classes, one
                cannot stay concentrated while staring at a computer screen for long. The length of an online
                class should not exceed 30-40 minutes. Teachers should keep that in mind and plan their
                lectures accordingly. If they have to take a longer class, they can try giving a 5-minute break
                in the middle. Also, there should be a break between back-to-back classes for the eyes to rest.</p>


            <h4>Devising a Dependable Evaluation System:
            </h4>
            <p>As any assuring alternatives to written tests are yet to be discovered, many standardized tests
                are yet to find any alternative to onsite written exams. Nonetheless, as universities have more
                flexibility with regards to their evaluation methods and so, many cost-effective and efficient
                methods of virtual examination can be put in place to compensate for traditional methods, as
                well as tackling plagiarism. Schools and universities can consider a system comprising oral
                viva, assignments with deadlines, open-book written exams, presentations and multiple-choice
                questions. In addition, institutions can also benefit from using LMS, Google Tools to keep
                17
                track of grades and exam tracking software such as ExamSoft to monitor any dishonesty. The
                UGC must innovate a method to make these cost-effective for everyone.</p>

            <h4> Providing Training and Devices to Teachers</h4>
            <p>In the survey conducted for this report, 55.1% of all students recommended providing training
                to teachers through initiatives by the Government or their respective institutions as a way to
                improve the quality of online education in this pandemic. This was also deemed the most
                effective step for improving quality by 11.1% of the responders. To accomplish this vital
                requirement, the following steps may be considered:
            </p>


            <ul>
                <li><strong>Arrangement of Broadcasts by Teachers' Training Colleges: </strong>In a 2011 study
                    conducted by Mohammad Ataur Rahman, on a scale of 0 to 4, the average level of IT
                    skills of teacher educators at the TTC, Rajshahi was found to be only 2.36. Thus, it is
                    necessary to train the teacher educators first and then arrange national broadcast
                    programs for teachers of all levels to train them in the use of digital devices, digital
                    learning management and communication apps.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Providing Teachers with Devices: </strong>According to the 8th National Pay Scale, a teacher
                    earns an average of 25,000 taka monthly, which is abysmally low considering that even
                    a very basic personal computer may cost around 30,000 taka. Therefore, it is vital to
                    provide teachers with devices for conducting classes under a government initiative.
                    Tablet computers may be the most practical choice considering both utility and
                    affordability.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Recruitment of Additional IT Staff to Assist Teachers: </strong>As the education sector has
                    become massively dependent on IT, recruiting some additional IT staff may help guide
                    teachers unfamiliar with this newer technology by reallocating expenditure from utility
                    costs that are saved due to conducting classes remotely. Maintenance workers in the
                    technology sector are also permitted by law enforcement to offer emergency services
                    during lockdowns following the suggested health and safety regulations.</li>
